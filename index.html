<p>

The Staten Island Greenbelt is a valuable natural and recreational resource for Staten Island and New York City as a whole. It is a place where people can escape the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy the natural world.

<h2>Common Creatures of the Isle:</h2>

<div class="images">

<div>
    <h7 class="icon_header">Skunks</h7>
    <img src="images/noun-skunk-white.png" alt="Silouette of a skunk.">
    <p>There is no official estimate of the current population of skunks on Staten Island. However, according to some wildlife experts, the skunk population is on the rise, and are being seen more frequently in residential areas. Skunks are adaptable animals and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including urban areas. They are also omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals, making it easy for them to find food in urban areas.</p>

<div>
    <h7 class="icon_header">Deers</h7>
    <img src="images/noun-deer-white.png" alt="Silouette of a deer.">
    <p>The current population of deer in Staten Island is estimated to be around 1,452. This is a decrease of about 30% since the start of a vasectomy program in 2016. The vasectomy program is a non-lethal way to control the deer population, and it has been successful in reducing the number of deer-related car accidents and other conflicts between humans and deer.

<div>
    <h7 class="icon_header">Turkeys</h7>
    <img src="images/noun-turkey-white.png" alt="Silouette of a turkey.">
    <p>The turkey population on Staten Island has grown significantly in recent years. There is no official estimate, but Audubon Society volunteers counted 143 turkeys in December 2021. Other environmentalists estimate that there are closer to 500 turkeys on the island. There is no current plan to control the turkey population on Staten Island. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has said that it is not feasible to relocate the turkeys, and that the best way to manage the population is to learn to coexist with them.

    <h7 class="icon_header">Snakes</h7>
    <img src="images/noun-snake-white.png" alt="Silouette of a snake.">
    <p>Although the current population is unknown, garter snakes are the most common species on Staten Island. They can be found in a variety of habitats, including marshes, grasslands, and woodlands. Garter snakes are non-venomous and play an important role in the ecosystem by helping to control populations of pests such as frogs, toads, and mice. They are also a food source for other animals such as birds of prey and carnivorous mammals.</p>
